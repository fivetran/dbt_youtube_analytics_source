# YouTube Analytics (Source)
This package models YouTube Analytics data from [Fivetran's connector](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/youtube-analytics#youtubeanalytics). It uses data in the format described by the [YouTube Channel Report schemas](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/youtube-analytics#schemainformation).

## Models
This package contains staging models, designed to work simultaneously with our [YouTube Analytics modeling package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_youtube_analytics). The staging models name columns consistently across all packages:
 * Boolean fields are prefixed with `is_` or `has_`
 * Timestamps are appended with `_timestamp`
 * ID primary keys are prefixed with the name of the table. For example, the video_metadata table's ID column is renamed `video_id`.

## Installation Instructions
Check [dbt Hub](https://hub.getdbt.com/) for the latest installation instructions, or [read the dbt docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/package-management) for more information on installing packages.

Include in your `packages.yml`

```yaml
packages:
  - package: fivetran/youtube_analytics_source
    version: [">=0.1.0", "<0.2.0"]
```
## Configuration
## Required YouTube Channel Reports
To use this package you will need to pull the following YouTube Analytics reports through Fivetran:
- [channel_basic_a2](https://developers.google.com/youtube/reporting/v1/reports/channel_reports#video-user-activity) (required)
- [channel_demographics_a1](https://developers.google.com/youtube/reporting/v1/reports/channel_reports#video-viewer-demographics) (optional)
- [videos metadata table](write-up_to_go_here) (optional)

### Schema Configuration
By default, this package will look for your YouTube Analytics data in the `youtube_analytics` schema of your [target database](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/running-a-dbt-project/using-the-command-line-interface/configure-your-profile). If this is not where your YouTube Analytics data is, please add the following configuration to your `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
# dbt_project.yml

...
config-version: 2

vars:
    youtube_analytics_schema: your_schema_name
    youtube_analytics_database: your_database_name 
```
### YouTube Video Metadata

The Fivetran YouTube Analytics connector currently does not support video metadata. Consequently, it may be difficult to analyze individual video data without knowing which video belongs to which record. 

As a workaround, you can create a [Functions connector](https://fivetran.com/docs/functions) that syncs your YouTube video metadata into a table in your destination. This dbt package can then use the `VIDEOS` metadata table to enrich your YouTube Analytics reporting data. To learn more about creating a Functions connector, read our [YouTube Analytics Video Metadata Cloud Function article](to_be_created_write-up_link_here). It provides code and detailed steps on how to configure the function. 

### Enable Video Metadata

By default, the video metadata functionality within this package is disabled. If you have [configured a cloud function to sync your video metadata into a `VIDEOS` table](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_youtube_analytics_source/blob/main/README.md#youtube-video-metadata), you must enable the video metadata functionality to incorporate the metadata into your package. You may use the variable configuration below in your `dbt_project.yml` to enable this functionality:

```yml
# dbt_project.yml

...
vars:
  youtube__using_video_metadata: true # false by default
```

### Video Metadata Schema Configuration

By default, this package will look for your `VIDEOS` YouTube Analytics metadata table in the `youtube_metadata_schema` schema of your [target database](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/running-a-dbt-project/using-the-command-line-interface/configure-your-profile). If this is not where your YouTube Analytics metadata table is, please add the following configuration to your `dbt_project.yml` file:
```yml
# dbt_project.yml

...
config-version: 2

vars:
    youTube_metadata_schema: your_schema_name
    youTube_analytics_database: your_database_name 
```
### Specifying Source Table Names

This package assumes that the `channel_basic_a2` and `channel_demographics_a1` reports are named accordingly. If these reports have different names in your destination, enter the correct names in the `channel_basic_table_name` and/or `channel_demographics_table_name` variables in your `dbt_project.yml` so that the package can find them:

```yml
# dbt_project.yml

...
vars:
  youtube__channel_basic_table:         "my_channel_basic_table_name"
  youtube__channel_demographics_table:  "demographics_youtube_report"
```

### Changing the Build Schema

By default, this package will build the YouTube Analytics staging models within a schema titled (`<target_schema>` + `_stg_youtube_analytics`) in your target database. If this is not where you would like your YouTube Analytics staging data to be written to, add the following configuration to your `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
# dbt_project.yml

...
models:
    youtube_analytics_source:
      +schema: my_new_schema_name # leave blank for just the target_schema
```

## Database Support

This package has been tested on BigQuery, Snowflake, Redshift, Postgres, and Databricks.

### Databricks Dispatch Configuration
dbt `v0.20.0` introduced a new project-level dispatch configuration that enables an "override" setting for all dispatched macros. If you are using a Databricks destination with this package, you will need to add the dispatch configuration below (or a variation of the below) within your `dbt_project.yml`. This is required in order for the package to accurately search for macros within the `dbt-labs/spark_utils` then the `dbt-labs/dbt_utils` packages respectively.

```yml
# dbt_project.yml

dispatch:
  - macro_namespace: dbt_utils
    search_order: ['spark_utils', 'dbt_utils']
```
